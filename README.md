Memory
======

Classic game of Memory in Python


This game was developed as part of an assignment for Rice University's 
course Interactive Programming in Python. Due to it being developed on 
an online platform, it might not run in every Python IDE. Therefore, 
the easiest way to run this program is to access this link[1] and click Run.

This is an implementation of the classic game of Memory. The player clicks
on two cards to turn them over. If they match they remain face up. If they
do not, a third click causes the first two cards to turn face down again.
The game is over when all cards are face up. The restart button clears the 
score and restarts the game.
